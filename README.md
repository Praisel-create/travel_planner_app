Wanderl – A Frontend Learning Journey

It is a beginner-friendly travel planning app built as part of my journey to become a proficient front-end developer. It allows users to search destinations, explore flight offers, and build personalized itineraries — while giving me hands-on experience with React, APIs, and clean UI design using Tailwind CSS.

This project represents is helping me in not just in code, but in consistency, creativity, and confidence.

Through I’m learning how to:

- Build responsive and interactive UI with **React**
- Manage user input and component state
- Fetch real-time data using the **Amadeus Travel API**
- Handle async loading and error states
- Store user data with **localStorage**
- Style consistently using **Tailwind CSS**
- Break features into clean, reusable components

It’s far from perfect — but every commit is a win.
